# I - Talk for Vision Pro

This app is made for kids with disabilities who might find it tricky to verbally communicate properly. 
It's bright and easy to use, so they can dive right in without needing to read. 
With 3 fun activities, it helps them sharpen their listening and learning capabilities. Also, this is an experiment to try the new Vision Os development tools.
